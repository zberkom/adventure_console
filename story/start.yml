title: The Old Republic!!!
description: You are a young student in the jedi academy. Unfortunately, you don't seem to have the force capabilities that they thought you did. It is a time of crisis, the Sith empire has returned to coroban and the republic must endeavor to find as many jedi as possible, in order to combat the host of invaders. So, you will lose your place in the school if you cannot find a way to boost your force powers enough to reach the aspirations that Tartus (The jedi master, and leader of the republic) has set for you. There is an old ledgend about a stone that could give you all the force powers that you are capable of having. This seems to be your only choice. You prepare to take a shuttle to Geron, where the stone was last seen many years ago. The academy allows you to take three items of your choice from the academy, what will you choose?

            #Question 
        
  - text: You peep through a crack in between the barrels and see that a fleet of Six TIE fighters have landed, escorting what you thought was an imperial shuttle. They all land and a battalion of imperial droids march out of a door in the side of the landing doc. The door of the shuttle lowers and your worst fears are realized a black caped Sith walks out. 
    options:
      - text: Sneak out the door behind you.
        goto_file: wrong_way.yml
      
      - text: Enter the trap door that is right underneath you using your lock pick.
